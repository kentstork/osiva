Logrithmic arrow keys for moving the image.

Transparency is not consistent with different size images. Mask thinning should be insensitive to scale factor -- absolute image size should be what matters.

When an image region is expanded in transparency it needs to refresh the image data, in case there was mask information showing.

** Context menu zoom needs to center the image properly.

The key for closing an image should be [del], not escape. Escape should be used to stop lengthy operations, especially group resizes and drops.

Tile twice should not do twice the work.

The fit screen iconbar icon should fit all images to the screen. It's OK for the iconbar to change to a progress indication.
